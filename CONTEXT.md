We are working on a dark sci-fi short story. The story premise and character description will be made easily available on a different app, Z Rooms, which has various ambient audio options available and already has text-to-speech funcitonality as well as an optional story mode and optional poetry mode. We would also add each chapter and corresponding poem from this project to that app, as optional content for the text-to-speech. 

We want to write an interesting dark sci-fi story with some body horror elements. We want to also create a collection of poems, mostly rhyming but perhaps some free verse, based on the subject matter. Users of the app will be able to go between story mode and poetry mode in the Z Rooms app. 

---- 
Important context about Z Rooms:

I have a short dark sci-fi story (in story/), and these poems in poems/ are all derived from that story. I have an app with ambient audio and in order to listen to the next chapter users need to go into different "rooms", each having their own looping never ending ambient audio, and user can optionally set a waking time and waking audio ambient loop, and they can optionally enable story mode for the short story, or enable poetry mode which randomly plays from a collection of poems (in poemms/) based on the short story.

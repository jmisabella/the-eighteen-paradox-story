# High level plan for fleshing out the story

### Chapter Structure & Scene Breakdown

Decide total chapter count: 10-12 chapters, as the mystery mechanism suggests 10-12 chapters might serve this story better than our other story which is 7-8 chapters. Act 1's misdirection benefits from more atmospheric establishment. 

Should each chapter end on a specific type of beat?
We feel chapters should end on atmospheric moments that let the ambient sound linger. 

### CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT

Regarding character dcevelopment, we want to let them emerge as we outline specific scenes: outline what needs to happen in each chapter, then develop characters as needed for those moments. This is more organic and less pre-planned. 

We need to determine how many total characters with speaking roles: 
- Minimal cast (Reed + 2-3 others) for intimacy?
- Larger ensemble (Reed + 5-6 others) for variety?

Perhaps this would be better determined after we flesh out chapter ideas though...

### STORY PACING

The "transformation reveal" happens early Act 2. In a chapter structure, where should this fall?
- Chapter 4 of 10? (40% through - follows the 40% Act 2 guideline)
- Chapter 5 of 12? (Similar timing)
This affects how much mystery-building we have

Time skips in Act 3. Handle in one chapter or across multiple?
- Single chapter showing passage of years?
- Multiple chapters showing gradual change?

# Plan for next session
- Chapter count is already decicided: 10-12 chapters.
- Map acts to chapters
- Create scene-by-scene breakdown for each chapter
- Identify natural stopping points for TTS
- Estimate timing/word counts

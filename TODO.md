- **Act 3**: Chapters 9-11 (30% of story, ~7,500-9,000 words)
- **Total**: ~25,500-30,000 words (~2-2.5 hours reading time)

### ✅ Chapter Endings: Atmospheric moments for TTS
All chapters end on atmospheric beats suitable for ambient sound to linger. Each chapter is 10-20 minutes of listening time.

### ✅ Scene-by-Scene Breakdown: Complete
Detailed breakdown created in [CHAPTER_BREAKDOWN.md](CHAPTER_BREAKDOWN.md) including:
- 2-4 major scenes per chapter
- Key dialogue beats
- Tone and pacing notes
- Word count targets for each chapter
- TTS stop points (end of each chapter)

### ✅ Transformation Reveal: Chapter 5
- Chapter 5 "Transfer" contains the transformation reveal
- Double consciousness moment is peak horror
- Positioned at ~40% through story (early Act 2)
- Perfect timing for mystery payoff

### ✅ Time Skip: Chapter 10
- Single chapter showing passage of years
- Reed transformed from victim to complicit trainer
- Years deliberately vague to emphasize emotional change over timeline

### CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT

Character decisions made:
- **Core cast**: Reed (protagonist), Kess (friend), Mira (friend)
- **Supporting**: Various Operators, trainees, Unit-3,784 (soon-to-amalgamate)
- Minimal cast approach chosen for intimacy
- Characters emerge organically through scenes as planned
- Additional characters developed as needed per scene

# Next Steps (Future Sessions)

## Immediate Next: Begin Writing Prose

Now that chapter structure is complete, begin actual story writing:

1. **Start with Chapter 1: "Seventeen Days"**
   - Use scene breakdown from CHAPTER_BREAKDOWN.md
   - Follow tone guidelines from WRITING_GUIDE.md
   - Target: 2,000-2,500 words
   - Opening line option: "Reed had seventeen days left in their body, and they were trying not to think about it."

2. **Write sequentially through chapters**
   - Chapter 1 → Chapter 2 → Chapter 3, etc.
   - Each chapter complete before moving to next
   - Review against WRITING_GUIDE.md for consistency
